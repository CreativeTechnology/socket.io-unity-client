Usage:
	- Put these files somewhere in your Unity3D project
	- Set host and port of socket in "Example.cs"
	- Append Example.cs to a GameObject in Unity editor
	- Connects to the socket.io socket just as any other
	  socket.io client. Uses the WebSocket transport.

Disclaimer:
	- Does not support secure connections. Also the handshake doesn't
	  work yet.

Roadmap:
	- Use events instead of interface implementation
	- Fix handshakes
