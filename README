Usage:
	- Put these files somewhere in your Unity3D project
	- Modify the url of the socket in "Example.cs"
	- Append Example.cs to a GameObject in Unity editor
	- ...
	- Currently it expects messages to just contain "red" "green" or "blue",
	  changing the color of an object "cube" accordingly. (define the object
	  by drag'n'dropping it into the field "cube" in the inspector).
	  
Disclaimer:
	- Does not support secure connections. Also the handshake doesn't
	  work yet.
	- Frames the data like this: 0x00~m~[datalen]~m~[data]0xff ...
	  and expects incomming data to be framed like this, as it is
	  default on socket.io-node)
